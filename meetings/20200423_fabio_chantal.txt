* work plan for me
  * WP1: Chantal gives the okay, so this should be ready.
    * Make sure documentation is picco bello, but there might be need for clarification.
  * KSB data not in the right format, I said to keep me in the CC
  * WP3: Maybe I can also go there, install OGER there and so on, in doing so circumvene the need to transfer.
    * Or if Lausanne has the data, she can set up a remote access.
  * WP4: Can evaluation also be done on Baden data?
  * WP5: Another publication? At least fill in the document
* progress form
