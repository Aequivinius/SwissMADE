### Manually Annotated Subset
* 300 unique reports where selected to be manually annotated as follows:
   * It represents a stratified sample in regards to the **relevant** ICD-10 codes (as per `codes/Code_List...xlsx`).
   * Under the condition that for every relevant ICD-10 code, there is **at least one** document containing that code
   * 42 reports selected randomly from the entire set without regard to their diagnoses were added to bring the subset size to 300, making up for rounding and reports containing multiple relevant ICD-10 codes.
