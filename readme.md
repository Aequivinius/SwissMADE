### Manually Annotated Subset

* Some reports have a structured section in which diagnoses are listed with their ICD-10 codes. These are not 100% reliable though. Still, we are using these to predict ADEs, focusing on 3 (4 if time permits) events: severe hemorage, pulmonary embolism, stroke (and AMI). For each of these, a set of 100 reports was created, taking as many positives as were found, and filling up the remaining positions with reports with for which no ADEs where predicted.
